# Disappearing Text Writing App
If you stop writing for more than 5 seconds, all your progress will be erased. This is an app for those with writer's block.

## Instructions: <br/>
Select how many minutes you would like to write for. <br/> 
You can choose to write based on a random prompt generated or without a prompt. <br/>
If you don't write anything for 5 seconds, all the text you've typed will be deleted. <br/> 
At the end of the selected time, whatever text you have written will be saved so you can have a copy of all of your work.<br/> 
All your saved work will be under the directory "writing" in the file "written_texts.txt".
